# EarthquakePredictions
A data mining project that attempts to understand geospatial data and 3-D visualize it to analyze earthquake data. Spatial region based trends, Earthquake prediction trends visualized using spatial data.

Dataset: Global Catalog of Calibrated Earthquake Locations Harley M. Benz, 2021, Global Catalog of Calibrated Earthquake Locations, U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P95R8K8G.

Use ML to predict earthquake trends and visualize them This problem is widely applicable to a lot of organizations that can use this data to decide on how to best manage the incoming disaster. Currently they are predicted using volcanic activity and seismic movements. Our solution will look at previous trends and try to predict epicenters within a certain radius
